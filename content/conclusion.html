<h1> Conclusion </h1>
This lab was to produce a robot which can translated a DNA sequence into movements. 
This robot produces diagrams of DNA sequences which can be compared to other sequences and compare their similaries and differences. We can use it to determine mutations in DNA sequences as well. 
This robot can be easily modified to be an RC toy by using bluetooth commands of A, T, C, and G to control the toy.
